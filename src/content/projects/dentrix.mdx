Dentrix is a dental CAD desktop application, built using C++, Python, and Rust.

It was my capstone project, where I was part of the AI team — working on data preparation and teeth segmentation — and also part of the Computational Geometry (CG) team, focusing on mesh reconstruction and arch alignment.

## AI

Tools used: Pytorch, Sci-Kit Image, Sci-Kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, ONNX

### Dataset Preparation

The dataset used is **Teeth3DS**, first introduced at MICCAI 2022. It was developed through a collaboration between **Udini (France)**, the **Inria Grenoble Morpheo team (France)**, and the **Digital Research Center of Sfax (Tunisia)**.

I performed extensive statistical and geometrical analysis on the dataset with full EDA.

The most important insights were:

- The kurtosis of the Z-axis is 3.9, indicating synthetic characteristics. Some vertices can be ignored as they represent cast depth.  
- The median number of teeth vertices is approximately 24K points, which was used for downsampling the meshes into point clouds. This left room for augmentation in 50% of the training data.
- All data points are **non-watertight** and **non-manifold**.

### Models Implemented

Initially, I implemented **MeshCNN** to avoid sampling overhead. However, it failed since it requires manifold data.

I then worked with point clouds and implemented **PointNet**, which showed promising results but suffered from **class imbalance**.

### Key Results

- Reduced memory usage from **21 GB and 90 min/epoch** (original, with online sampling) to:
  - **10 GB**, with a **52.4% memory reduction**, same epoch time (90 min) but **15 min for cached epochs**, using online sampling with caching of the next 5 epochs.
  - **6 GB**, with a **71% memory reduction** and **12 min/epoch**, by using the median number of vertices as a sampling threshold and performing offline sampling before training.
- Achieved **90.8% Accuracy** and nearly **80% IoU** on the test set.

### Results

As seen above, due to class imbalance, the **gums** were predicted almost perfectly. However, the **teeth** occasionally had regions misclassified as gum.

## Computational Geometry

Teeth alignment is crucial for understanding the context of a prepared tooth, ensuring optimal bite strength and accurate jaw closure — making it ready for subsequent dental procedures.

Tools used: C++, PMP library
