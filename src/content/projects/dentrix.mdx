Dentrix is a teeth CAD Desktop application, built using C++, python and rust.

It was my capstone project, and I was part of the AI team where I worked on Data prepration and teeth Segementation, and also part of the Computional Geometry team (CG), where I worked on Mesh reconstruction and Arch alignment.

## AI

### Dataset Prepration

The dataset used is Teeth3DS, which first introduced at MICCAI 2022. It was developed through a collaboration between **Udini (France)**, the **Inria Grenoble Morpheo team (France)**, and the **Digital Research Center of Sfax (Tunisia)**.

I made an extensive statstical and geomtrical analysis onthe data with full EDA.

The most Important insights where:

- The kurtosis of Z-axis is 3.9, which means it's synthic, and we could Ignore some of its vertices as it represents cast depth.  
- Median of teeth vertices is 24K points nearly, which is used for sampling the meshes into Pointclouds, leaving space for Augmentation for 50% of training data, as all of its vertices is used
- all data points are non-watertight and non-manifold

### Models Implemented

First I tried implementing meshCNN tom avoid sampling overhead, but it failed as it only accepts manifold data.
So I tried working with Pointclouds and Implemented PointNet, and it showed promising results, but suffered from dataset Impalance.

### Plots

<div

    display: 'flex',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    gap: '1rem',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }}

  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 200px', maxWidth: '400px' }}>
    <Image src={acc} alt="Accuracy" width={400} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 200px', maxWidth: '400px' }}>
    <Image src={iou} alt="IoU" width={400} />
  </div>

### Results

as can be seen due to impalance gums are almost predicted perfectly, but teeth on the other hand have parts classified as gum.
