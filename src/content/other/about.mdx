I'm Mohamed Yaser, a backend engineer and machine learning enthusiast from Egypt with a strong foundation in Computer Engineering. I thrive on building scalable, efficient systems and enjoy tackling meaningful, real-world problems.

As a hands-on learner, I prefer to understand technologies from the ground up, relying on core computer science principles rather than just frameworks. I value clarity, performance, and clean design in both code and architecture.

Beyond backend development, I’m actively exploring research-driven AI applications, particularly in the medical and 3D vision domains. I’m committed to continuous growth, whether it’s deepening my OS knowledge to optimize project resources, learning new model training techniques, or fine-tuning SQL queries for better performance.

I am currently open to opportunities where I can apply my technical skills, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to impactful products.
